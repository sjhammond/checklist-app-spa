        <p>As with all servers, make sure IP address, network mask, default gateway, and DNS server settings are set correctly. Milestone recommends using static IP addresses on your XProtect VMS servers.</p>
        <p>It is possible to change the IP address of a server at any time; however, in many cases this will require some additional configuration to ensure the services communicate correctly. Consequently, Milestone recommends configuring the server as it is intended to run in production before installing any XProtect VMS software onto it.</p>
