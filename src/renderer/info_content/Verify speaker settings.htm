        <h3 class="Heading3">16E. Verify speaker settings</h3>
        <p>Verify the Speaker settings for each microphone or microphone group on the Devices &gt; Speakers &gt; Settings tab and change them as needed.</p>
        <p>Selecting a group allows you to change settings on all the cameras in the group and any subgroups at the same time. As most settings are hardware device driver specific, you can filter the group by hardware device in the dropdown list at the top of the Properties window.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Some microphone devices may not have any settings, in which case the Properties window will be blank.</p>
