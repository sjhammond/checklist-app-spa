        <h3 class="Heading3">32A. Replace a hardware device</h3>
        <p>If you need to replace a hardware device (because the old device has stopped working or you are upgrading to an improved device from the same or a different manufacturer), the Replace Hardware wizard allows you to retain many of the settings from the old device as well as all recordings, View Group settings, and user permissions.</p>
        <p>On the Servers &gt; Recording Servers node in the Management Client, select the Recording Server the old device is installed to. Right-click on the old device and select Replace Hardware to start the wizard.</p>
