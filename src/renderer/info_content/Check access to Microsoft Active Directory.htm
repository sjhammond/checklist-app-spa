        <p>Microsoft Active Directory<sup>®</sup> is a distributed directory service implemented by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. With Active Directory installed, you can add Active Directory groups and users to XProtect VMS roles in addition to Basic Users or Windows users defined locally on the Management Server.</p>
        <p>Milestone recommends using Active Directory groups over individually defined users whenever possible, thereby keeping all individual user management in one central location.</p>
        <p>To add Active Directory groups (or users) to the XProtect VMS, you must have a server with Active Directory installed and acting as domain controller available on your network.</p>
        <p>Milestone recommends you verify that you have the necessary Active Directory groups for all user roles defined before you start configuring the XProtect VMS so you don’t have to interrupt your work to take care of this later.</p>
