        <p>Generic events allow you to trigger actions in the XProtect Event Server by sending simple strings via the IP network to your system. In this way, you may integrate the XProtect VMS with external sources, such as access control systems and alarm systems without a dedicated integration.</p>
        <p>To avoid jeopardizing security, the Generic Event function is disabled by default and, when enabled, accepts only events originating on the management server itself (localhost) or explicitly specified IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.</p>
        <p>If you will be using Generic Events, you must enable and configure the data source parameters, including the receiving port and allowed protocols and external sender IP addresses, on the Tools &gt; Options &gt; Generic Events tab.</p>
