        <p>In a multi-server installation, there are some additional considerations to consider if installing in a workgroup environment or if installing as part of a Milestone Federated Arcitecture.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Workgroup:</p>
        <p>In a Workgroup environment, Milestone generally recommends that all servers (Management Server, Recording and Failover Recording Servers, and Mobile servers) are installed to run under the same user name (for example, administrator), if possible. </p>
        <p>The user must be a member of the administrators group in Windows user management on the server. </p>
        <p>The reason for this is that the Data Collector service, which is installed along with all XProtect VMS servers, does not have permission to send data to the Management Server when running under the NETWORK SERVICE user in a Workgroup environment. This, in turn, results in the System Monitor and Customer Dashboard features (if available) not being able to monitor and display the health and performance of those servers.</p>
        <p>If it is not possible to install a server (for example, a Recording Server) to run under the same user name as the Management Server, you should still install the Management Server to run under a specific user account. You can change the user running the Data Collector service after the installation completes.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Milestone Federated Architecture (MFA):</p>
        <p>In an MFA system, all Management Servers must be installed to run under the same user name (for example, administrator). If you are installing in a Windows domain environment, the user must be a domain user and must be a member of the administrators group in Windows user management on the server.</p>
