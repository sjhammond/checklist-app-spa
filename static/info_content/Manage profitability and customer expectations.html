        <h3 class="Heading3"><span class="span_2">33I. </span>Manage profitability and customer expectations</h3>
        <p>Good project management, and by extension good project documentation, is key to maintaining customer expectations and project profitability, both of which are, of course, critical to grow the business.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Explain the importance of a Statement of Work (SOW) </h4>
        <p>When finalizing the project documentation prior to the installation, be sure to include a detailed Statement of Work (SOW). The SOW sets the customer’s expectations in writing, with specific details on how the project will be installed. Any work requested by the customer beyond what is documented is a change order and additional billable work.</p>
        <p>A SOW may often be vague in the initial phase, gradually getting more detailed until a bid can be submitted and the project secured. After that, the SOW should get more detailed as the customer’s requirements are settled in full until the point when it contains a full “to-be-built” specification the integrator and customer can both sign off on.</p>
        <p>For the part of the project that applies to the Milestone system, the SOW (or more commonly in larger projects, a sub-document or appendix to the SOW) should contain sufficient detail in all sections of the document to enable the installation team to install the system from the document with minimal interaction from the customer.</p>
        <p>The SOW also provides the template for the final acceptance test.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Explain the importance of acceptance testing (Final Acceptance Test, FAT)</h4>
        <p>The Final Acceptance Test (FAT) is the last step before the customer takes ownership of the installation.</p>
        <p>If sufficiently detailed, the SOW and the associated sequential checklist (i.e., this document) contain everything that was agreed upon when the customer accepted the scope and price of the proposed project.</p>
        <p>Going through each of the steps in the SOW together with the customer is your proof that the project delivered is the project the customer bought. </p>
        <p>Getting the customer’s signature on the FAT document swiftly and without need for major corrections is therefore key in closing the project to everyone’s satisfaction and, typically, critical for the customer to release the final payment to your company.</p>
        <p>It is also a great time to suggest and secure a contract for additional work that might not have been included in the original project (including change orders) or that addresses additional needs the customer might have.</p>
