        <p>Rules are a central element that controls all actions within XProtect VMS.</p>
        <p>XProtect VMS includes a number of rules as part of the installation. Most of these rules are enabled by default to enable the most common basic features without your needing to set anything up. For example, rules for starting the video feeds to the cameras and recording when motion is detected are enabled by default.</p>
        <p>Review the default rules on the Rules and Events &gt; Rules node and determine which ones should be disabled, enabled, or modified to meet the behavior requirements of the installation.</p>
        <p>Be aware that, because the rules in the most literal sense determine all actions, if you modify or deactivate the default rules, your system will respond accordingly. This means if you delete or disable all the default rules, the system will not do anything at all until you replace them with rules of your own.</p>
