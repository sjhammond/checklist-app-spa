        <h3 class="Heading3">31A. Perform a walk test for all cameras with motion detection</h3>
        <p>For all cameras that are set to record, or in other ways use video motion detection for event control, walk through all areas where you need the camera to detect motion. Make sure to cover edges of the area and repeat the test walking both directions, as appropriate.</p>
        <p>Be careful not to walk or move faster than typical motion in the field of view would be, as faster motion more easily triggers detection. If the light condition varies significantly (for example, night and day), repeat the test under as many different conditions as you can.</p>
        <p>If a camera is installed for a specialized purpose, you should adapt the test to the best fit. For example, if the camera is intended primarily for recording vehicle traffic, you should drive rather than walk for that test. </p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Confirm or re-adjust motion detection settings for each camera</h4>
        <p>Confirm, either by looking at the recordings (if recording on motion detection) or by having a colleague monitor the motion detection level in real time during the walk test, that the motion is detected correctly and that false detections are at a minimum.</p>
        <p>Adjust the settings as necessary and re-do the test. Evaluate if the results are satisfactory or if the motion detection needs to be supplemented or replaced with other detection options to meet the surveillance objectives specified in the system design document.</p>
