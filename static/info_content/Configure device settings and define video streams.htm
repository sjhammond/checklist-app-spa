        <h3 class="Heading3"><span class="span_2">15B. </span>Configure device settings and define video streams</h3>
        <p>Set up the image and streaming parameters for a camera or a camera group on the Devices &gt; <br />Cameras &gt; Settings tab.</p>
        <p>Selecting a group allows you to change settings all at once on all the cameras in that group and any subgroups. As most settings are hardware device driver specific, you can filter the group by hardware device in the dropdown list at the top of the Properties window.</p>
        <p>There is no memory associated with a device group; it is simply a way to easily select a large group of devices. Therefore, any change you make will be applied to the device, regardless of the previous setting. If the devices in the group currently have different values configured for a specific setting, the value field is shown as blank.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note</span><span class="span_3">: </span>The ability to change some device properties—for example, resolution, rotation, brightness, and similar image settings—is limited to groups of 400 devices or less.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Adjust general image settings</h4>
        <p>The general settings typically include image-related settings. On some devices, it may also include date and time stamp overlay settings and other settings that are common for all streams from the hardware device.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Examples of general image settings:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Brightness</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Contrast</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Saturation</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">White Balance</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Auto Iris/iris gain</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Day/Night mode</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Shutter speed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Select video stream resolution</h4>
        <p>Most cameras and encoders support setting up multiple streams to use for different purposes. </p>
        <p>Select the video stream resolution and quality/compression for the stream or streams you need for each camera or group of cameras. </p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Select video stream frame rate</h4>
        <p>Select the frame rate for the stream or streams you need for each camera or group of cameras.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Select video stream codec and streaming mode</h4>
        <p>Select the codec to use for the stream or streams you need for each camera or group of cameras.</p>
        <p>You may also want to adjust the streaming mode, if relevant, and if the setting is available.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Examples of streaming modes:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">RTP/RTSP/TCP</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">RTP/RTSP/HTTP/TCP</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">HTTP streaming</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">HTTP snapshot</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">RTP/UDP</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">RTP/UDP Multicast</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Specify video stream keyframe interval</h4>
        <p>Optionally, specify the keyframe interval or GOP (Group of Pictures) length for the stream or streams you need for each camera or group of cameras, if relevant, and if the setting is available.</p>
        <p>Milestone recommends using a GOP length of one second for most situations, and for most devices the Recording Server will automatically configure this when the device is added to the server. Manually adjusting the keyframe interval is usually relevant only if you need more frequent keyframes for motion detection or have set up grooming for the archive and need to ensure you have a certain number of keyframes per second available to meet the grooming specification.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Milestone discourages using very long keyframe intervals for both performance and evidence integrity reasons:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">The XProtect Smart Client requires a keyframe to start showing video, so a longer GOP may prolong the time before the video is displayed when changing views.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">The XProtect Smart Client needs to decode the entire GOP before showing the last frame when playing back video in reverse, so a longer keyframe interval may result in a sluggish playback performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">If the networks experience a packet drop, this will result in all video within the GOP being dropped, so a longer keyframe interval may result in evidence not being recorded. This will be especially pronounced if using a UDP streaming mode and the connection to the camera is poor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Not all XProtect VMS versions include grooming functionality.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Select video stream bitrate control, priority, and limits</h4>
        <p>Verify and adjust bitrate controls, priorities, and limits for the stream or streams you need for each camera or group of cameras, if relevant, and if the setting is available.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Examples of bitrate control settings:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Fixed bitrate, variable bitrate</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Frame rate or image quality priority</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Target bitrate</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Maximum bitrate</li>
        </ul>
