        <p>The XProtect VMS Recording Server usually communicates with hardware devices through either a device driver developed specifically for individual devices or a series of similar devices from the same manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Use the supported devices list on the Milestone website to verify whether your device is supported by a dedicated driver and what firmware versions the driver supports. </p>
        <p>If the firmware currently installed in the hardware device is not in the list, you <span class="span_4">must</span> install a supported version before installing the hardware device to the XProtect VMS. Milestone generally recommends you always install the latest supported firmware.</p>
        <p>The list also notes whether the driver is included in the regular device pack or the legacy device pack (a device pack containing drivers for older devices). If you need to connect to devices supported in the legacy device pack, you must download and install this separately before or—optionally, for new installations—after installing the recording server.</p>
