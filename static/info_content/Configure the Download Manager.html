        <h3 class="Heading3"><span class="span_2">33D. </span>Configure the Download Manager</h3>
        <p>The Download Manager determines what is available on the Management Server download web page.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Install Server-Side installers</h4>
        <p>You can add additional components to the download web page by downloading a server-side installer for that component from the Milestone website download section.</p>
        <p>For example, you may want to download and install “Server-Side XProtect Smart Client 64-bit” for a newer product version to allow users to upgrade their Smart Client to the new version before you upgrade the servers to maintain maximum compatibility and minimize interruptions to the production environment.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Manage access to downloads</h4>
        <p>You can manage what components are made available on both the user application installation page and the administrator application installation page through the Download Manager.</p>
        <p>The Download Manager is a separate application that is installed automatically along with the Management Server.</p>
        <p>Start the Download Manager from the application start menu/page when connected directly to the Management Server (locally or by remote desktop connection).</p>
