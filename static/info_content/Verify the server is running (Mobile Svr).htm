        <p>Once the install completes, verify the Milestone Mobile server notification area tray icon shows the server service has started correctly (i.e., the icon status is green).</p>
        <p>Log into the Mobile Server with the XProtect Web client from the server hosting the Mobile Server to verify the Mobile Server is responding correctly. Any user that has Windows administrator rights on the management server will work.</p>
        <p>Verify the Windows Firewall (if enabled) allows inbound access to all ports used by the Mobile server.</p>
        <p>Repeat the XProtect Web Client login test, this time from a PC or server on the client network. Verify both HTTP and HTTPS logins are working, if both are allowed in the Windows firewall.</p>
