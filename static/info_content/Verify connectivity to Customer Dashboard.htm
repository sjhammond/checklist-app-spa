        <p>The Customer Dashboard allows you, as an integrator, to monitor the health of your customers' systems in real time, receive status updates, and keep track of technical incidents. </p>
        <p>The Customer Dashboard information uses the System Monitor functionality and also provides you with the option to configure and receive system uptime reports and customizable notifications to help you address potential system issues before they disrupt a customer’s business.</p>
        <p>If you will be using the Customer Dashboard, you should verify the XProtect VMS is set up to send data to the portal on the Tools &gt; Options &gt; Customer Dashboard tab. <span class="BulletlistheadingChar">You must activate the license before the Customer Dashboard starts receiving</span><span class="BulletlistheadingChar"> messages from the XProtect VMS:</span></p>
