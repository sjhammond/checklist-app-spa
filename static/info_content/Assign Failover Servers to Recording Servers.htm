        <p>Select a Recording Server in the Servers &gt; Recording Servers node and open the Failover tab to assign a Failover Server or failover server group to the Recording Server.</p>
        <p>If you will be assigning a hot standby failover server to the Recording Server, simply select the Failover Server you want to assign to the Recording Server.</p>
        <p>Cold standby failover servers are assigned by failover groups that can be added to multiple Recording Servers. Assuming you have already created the failover groups and assigned the Failover Recording Servers to the intended groups (see references below), you can now assign a primary failover server group and, optionally, also a secondary failover server group to the Recording Server.</p>
        <p>If the system requirements state that not all cameras on the Recording Server should be part of the failover, you can specify which cameras to include in the advanced failover settings window.</p>
