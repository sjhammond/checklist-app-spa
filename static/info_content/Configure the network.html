        <p>As with all high-bandwidth IT systems, Layer 3 routing should generally be avoided inside the LAN and used only when necessary, such as at the edge of the network (e.g., between a LAN and the internet) or to facilitate wireless access.</p>
        <p>The issue is primarily one of performance. Naturally, the speed of the connection (upload and download) is critical, but even in situations where the bandwidth is plentiful, a routing engine—whether in a dedicated router or a Layer 3 switch—can process only a limited number of data packages per second, potentially limiting the number of camera feeds the connection can carry. </p>
        <p>If the installation includes a router and/or a firewall, you should ensure the bandwidth and routing performance required for the application are available before proceeding with the installation, as changes become increasingly difficult and expensive if the original assumptions are proven faulty later on.</p>
        <p>It is also important to be clear who is responsible for documenting and configuring the routing and firewall rules. Milestone uses a range of ports for the different services and functions which must be routed for the system to work correctly. While it is possible to change most of these, if desired, Milestone recommends using the default values unless there are significant reasons not to do so.</p>
        <p>Milestone recommends using VPN tunnel connections between different sites if the connection is made through the internet. A site in this context may be a complete XProtect VMS installation, a recording server, one or more remote cameras, or one or more Smart Client users. While it is certainly possible to set up simple port forwarding to allow such traffic without the use of VPN, this is inherently less secure and is, therefore, not recommended in most cases.</p>
        <p>Milestone considers it good practice to implement and test routing, firewall, wireless access points, and VPN settings and connections as early in the project as possible.</p>
