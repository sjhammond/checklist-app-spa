        <p>Combined with the settings on the remote system itself, the live streaming and recording possibilities are almost limitless. Typically, a remote system will be recording either on motion or always, while the default rules on the central system (assuming they have not been modified or disabled) will start the stream on all remote cameras (using a lot of bandwidth) and record those streams on motion.</p>
        <p>Configure the start feed and recording rules for the Interconnected cameras to meet the requirements in the system design document. </p>
        <p>Create any additional rules and alarms related to the events on the remote system.</p>
