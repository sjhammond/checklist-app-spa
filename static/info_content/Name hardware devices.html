        <h3 class="Heading3">14A. Name hardware devices</h3>
        <p>The name of the hardware device itself is used only by system administrators in the Management Client. To make device management as easy as possible, the name should ideally reflect key information about the device, such as the make and model, IP address or hostname, and the location of the device. </p>
        <p>You can add additional information under the description on the Info tab. This could include more details regarding precisely where the hardware device is located, who to contact for access, or information about warranty and servicing.</p>
