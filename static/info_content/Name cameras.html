        <p>Camera devices deliver video streams to the system that the client users can use to view live video or that the system can record for later playback by the client users. The camera name is visible both to system administrators in the Management Client and to all users who are permitted to access and view the camera.</p>
        <p>To make the system as easy to use as possible, the camera name should ideally describe what the camera “is looking at” as precisely and as briefly as possible. If the camera has special capabilities, such as PTZ functionality, panoramic view, or thermal imaging, it is generally helpful for the user if such capabilities are also indicated within the camera name itself.</p>
        <p>Because users and system administrators will be accessing and using cameras from the various client applications the exact same way regardless of make, model, and IP address, it is recommended not to include such information in the camera name.</p>
        <p>Also, because it is usually obvious to a user when they are working with a camera, including the word “camera” in the camera name is often redundant and makes the name longer than needed. So in most cases, “camera” can be omitted to make the name shorter and easier to read.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Some examples of “good” camera names:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Reception desk</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Reception entrance</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Reception elevator access</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Front entrance 180</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Front parking lot PTZ</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Market St. warehouse NW perimeter (thermal)</li>
        </ul>
