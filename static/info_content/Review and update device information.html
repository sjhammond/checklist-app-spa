        <h3 class="Heading3">15A. Review and update device information</h3>
        <p>For each camera, microphone, speaker, input, output, and metadata device, you can add a short name and description in addition to the full name on the Info tab for each individual device (Devices &gt; Cameras &gt; Info tab).</p>
        <p>The short name is useful if you use Smart Map in the Smart Client and you find the camera name is too long on the map. If you enter a short name, this will be displayed with the camera on the Smart Map instead of the full name, but with the full name still showing as a mouse-over tool tip. </p>
        <p>The description allows you to add any details and notes that may be useful to you or other system administrators when servicing the system at a later date.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Add device positioning information</h4>
        <p>For camera devices you can enter GPS positioning coordinates, camera direction, field of view (FoV), and depth of field (distance from the camera lens to the center of focus). The XProtect VMS uses this information to place the camera on the Smart Map.</p>
        <p>If a Smart Client user who has permissions to edit cameras and Smart Map adds or moves a camera, the new position will be reflected in the Management Client after a refresh.</p>
        <p>You can verify the correct placement on Google Maps through the Preview button (requires Internet access).</p>
        <p>A camera is removed from a Smart Map only if it is disabled or deleted, or if the GPS coordinates are deleted in the Management Client. Smart Client users do not have permission to remove cameras from a Smart Map.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Not all XProtect VMS versions include Smart Map functionality.</p>
