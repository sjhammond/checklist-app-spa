        <p>Configure the general behavior and capabilities of the XProtect Mobile server on the Servers &gt; Mobile Servers &gt; General tab.</p>
        <p>Make sure the name of the server is one that makes sense also when the system is serviced at a later date. Add a description of the location, intended use for the server, and anything else that may be useful months or years from now.</p>
        <p class="Notetext">The All cameras view is generally useful only in systems with a low number of cameras. In systems where you or the users themselves create customized views in the Smart Client, users have access to their normal Smart Client views in the XProtect Mobile client and the all cameras view can be disabled.</p>
        <p>If you have multiple mobile servers, they are each configured separately. Depending on your system requirements, you can configure each server with identical settingsâ€”for example, if you are simply dividing users onto different servers to share the load or using different settings because you need a different quality profile for some users.</p>
        <p>If you have multiple Mobile servers that should be configured identically, complete all the steps in this section on one server, export the mobile server configuration, then import it to each of the other servers.</p>
