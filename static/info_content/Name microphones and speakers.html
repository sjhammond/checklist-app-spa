        <p>Microphone devices deliver live audio streams to the system that the client users can listen to. </p>
        <p>Speaker devices receive an audio stream only when it is started by the system—typically when a user presses the talk button in XProtect Smart Client, or when playing back a prerecorded audio file. </p>
        <p>Both the microphone and speaker audio may be recorded for later playback. </p>
        <p>The microphone and speaker names are visible both to system administrators in the Management Client and to all users who are permitted to access and use microphones and speakers.</p>
        <p>To make the system as easy to use as possible, the microphone and speaker names should clearly and precisely communicate what the device is used for.</p>
        <p>Because users and system administrators will be accessing and using cameras from the various client applications the exact same way regardless of make, model, and IP address, it is recommended not to include such information in the camera name. However, unlike most cameras, it may often be useful to include their functions (“speaker” or “mic”) to mentally help keep those functions clear.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Some examples of “good” microphone and speaker names:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Front entrance intercom mic</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Branch 32 teller windows 1-3 mic</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">SAR-IF 149.080 MHz</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Front entrance intercom speaker</li>
        </ul>
