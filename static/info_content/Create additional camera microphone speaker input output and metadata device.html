        <p>Grouping of devices into device groups is part of the Add Hardware wizard but you can always modify the groups and add more groups, if needed. Each type of device (cameras, microphones, speakers, metadata, inputs, and outputs) has its own node under the Devices node.</p>
        <p>Device groups can be used by system administrators for managing and changing settings on multiple devices at once, with rules and with roles (user permissions). They can also be used by Smart Client users when creating views or manually selecting a camera for viewing or sharing through the Smart Wall.</p>
        <p>Thus, both system administrators and users can benefit from grouping devices into user-friendly categoriesâ€”for example, based on location, function, or intended user access. Devices can exist in multiple groups and you can further organize them by creating subgroups and subgroups within subgroups.</p>
