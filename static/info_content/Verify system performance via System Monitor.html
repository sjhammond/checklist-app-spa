        <h3 class="Heading3">25A. Verify system performance via System Monitor</h3>
        <p>The System Monitor provides you with a quick, visual overview of the current state of your system's servers and cameras through colored tiles that represent the system hardware. In addition, you can enable saving historic system monitor data on the System Dashboard &gt; System Monitor &gt; Customize menu.</p>
        <p>Even if you are not planning to use the historic data in the long term, Milestone recommends you enable it temporarily when you complete the system configuration to help validate the system is performing as expected. After the system has been running for a while, you can revisit this section to verify all values have remained satisfactory within the past 30 days (or however long the system has been running with a stable configuration). You can then disable the historical data option again if desired.</p>
        <p>Recording the history will place an additional load the SQL server database and connection, so don’t set the sampling interval shorter than you need it to be. Also, remember to disable the history again after that initial check if you do not intend to use it as part of a regular problem-prevention process.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> The System Monitor uses the Data Collector service to collect and generate data. In very large systems, the CPU load on the management server CPU to process the data from thousands of cameras may be overly excessive relative to its benefits, especially if you already use an external SNMP or Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) monitoring solution. In these cases, you may consider disabling the Data Collector service on all servers (Management Server, Recording Servers, mobile servers, etc.) to save resources.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify or customize system monitor thresholds</h4>
        <p>The System Monitor allows you to configure which system performance parameters you want to monitor, as well as the warning and critical levels for those parameters.</p>
        <p>Verify or change which parameters to monitor and adjust the warning and critical alarm threshold values to best fit the needs of the installation on the System Dashboard &gt; System Monitor Thresholds node for server, camera, disk, and storage (recording retention time).</p>
        <p>Adjust the calculation interval for each parameter as desired to best meet the need for responsive updates while still avoiding false alerts stemming from irrelevant value fluctuations.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify service status, CPU and memory usage on all servers</h4>
        <p>Verify the CPU and memory utilization of all servers by selecting the System Dashboard &gt; System Monitor &gt; All servers tile. Both should read out normal (green) if the parameter is enabled. If the parameter is not enabled (see above), the status indicator will be gray.</p>
        <p>Click the Details button for each critical server/service (at a minimum, the Management Server and all Recording Server services) and verify the actual CPU and memory usage values are within the expected range.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify free space and retention time on recording servers</h4>
        <p>Click the System Dashboard &gt; System Monitor &gt; All servers tile &gt; Details button for each Recording Server and verify the actual disk read and write rates, as well as the network bandwidth usage values, are within the expected range.</p>
        <p>To save time, you can combine this task with verifying the recording server CPU and memory utilization described above.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify frame rate and used space status for all cameras</h4>
        <p>Verify the camera frame rate status of all cameras by selecting the System Dashboard &gt; System Monitor &gt; All cameras tile. Both the Live FPS and Recording FPS should read out normal (green) if the parameter is enabled. If the parameter is not enabled (see above), the status indicator will be gray.</p>
        <p>If the Live FPS shows a warning (yellow) or critical (red) state, the Recording Server is not receiving the frame rate you have configured. If the camera is intended to be started (check the rules), you should verify and troubleshoot your settings, network connection, camera capabilities/specification, etc. until what the server receives matches the configuration.</p>
        <p>If the Recording FPS shows a warning or critical state and the camera should be recording (check the rules), you should verify the settings on the camera’s settings, stream, and record tabs are correct and that the recording server storage system is able to process the amount of data sent to it.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure system performance email notification rules</h4>
        <p>If not done under section 21D.</p>
