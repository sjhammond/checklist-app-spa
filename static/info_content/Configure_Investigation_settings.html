        <p>You can enable investigations so that people can use XProtect Web Client and Milestone Mobile to access recorded video, investigate incidents, and export and download video evidence.</p>
        <p>Enable and configure investigations for each Mobile server as required on the Servers &gt; Mobile Servers &gt; Investigations tab.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> While users create investigations and export data from the Web Client or Mobile client, the export is actually done by the Mobile server and all data is stored on the Mobile server. If users have access to log into more than one Mobile server, they will see only investigations and exports made on that specific server.</p>
