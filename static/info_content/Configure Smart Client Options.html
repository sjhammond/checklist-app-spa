        <h3 class="Heading3"><span class="span_2">28J. </span>Configure Smart Client Options</h3>
        <p>In addition to system administrators being able to customize the Smart Client features and settings for each role through Smart Client Profiles, users themselves are able to change any setting that isnâ€™t locked by the Smart Client Profile via the Settings menu.</p>
        <p>However, a few settings that are directly tied to the workstation hardware accessories (such as joystick, keyboard shortcut, and alarm notification settings), are configurable directly in the Smart Client only when logged in as the user the settings should apply to.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure joystick settings</h4>
        <p>For relevant users and workstations, log in as the user (or have the user log in) and configure joystick settings on the Smart Client Settings &gt; Joystick menu.</p>
        <p>Because the capabilities of attached joysticks may vary, joystick settings are specific to the user and the workstation. If the user will be logging into multiple workstations that have joysticks attached, these settings are saved as independent profiles and therefore must be configured on each workstation.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure keyboard shortcuts</h4>
        <p>For relevant users and workstations, log in as the user (or have the user log in) and configure keyboard shortcuts on the Smart Client Settings &gt; Keyboard menu.</p>
        <p>Because keyboard layouts and capabilities may vary, keyboard settings are specific to the user and the workstation. If the user will be logging into multiple workstations, these settings are saved as independent profiles and therefore must be configured on each workstation.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure alarm sound notification</h4>
        <p>For relevant users and workstations, log in as the user (or have the user log in) and configure whether alarm sound notifications should be played back in the workstation speakers on the Smart Client Settings &gt; Alarm menu.</p>
        <p>Because not all workstations may have sound cards or speakers, or may be used for different purposes, Alarm notifications are specific to the user and the workstation. If the user will be logging into multiple workstations, these settings are saved as independent profiles and therefore must be configured on each workstation.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify Smart Client time zone settings</h4>
        <p>While you are logged in as a user, double-check that the time zone settings are configured as intended. </p>
        <p>Even if the time zone setting is configured and locked through the Smart Client profile, this is an extra verification that the time the user will see, and will export evidence as, is correct.</p>
