        <h3 class="Heading3">27A. Activate license</h3>
        <p>If you have not activated the license after adding hardware devices (Included Interconnected cameras), these will still be running in the grace period (normally 30 days).</p>
        <p>Activate the license on the Basics &gt; License Information &gt; Activate License dropdown menu.</p>
        <p>Activating the license will also reset the permitted changes without activation limit and update the license with any additional licenses that may have been purchased since the last activation.</p>
        <p>If you forget to activate licenses before the grace period expires, they will stop sending video to the system. These licenses are shown in the Grace Period Expired column. See also Activate licenses after grace period.</p>
