        <p>The settings on the Overall Security tab comprise the primary way of defining permissions for the role.</p>
        <p>The XProtect VMS has a number of security groups, under which are a number of system components. For each component, you can configure the overall security to allow, deny, or remain undefined (no option selected).</p>
        <p>“Allow” allows the user associated with the role to use the component throughout the system, while “Deny” excludes the user from using the component throughout the system.</p>
        <p>If the overall security is undefined, the permissions are decided on an individual device/functionality detail level on the Roles tab to the right of the Overall Security tab. By default, all individual device/functionality detail level permissions settings are blank (no permissions given).</p>
        <p>When an overall security permission has been set (allowed or denied), the corresponding individual device/functionality detail level permission is grayed out because the permissions are determined globally by the overall security setting. Thus, unless the system design document requires differentiated permissions for a device or function, you need only configure the overall security for that device or function.</p>
        <p>Configure Overall Security settings for each role, as per your system design document, on the Overall Security tab for the role.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> You can associate a user with more than one role, in which case you may end up having conflicting settings. In this case, the XProtect VMS will always prioritize an overall security setting (allow or deny) over any individual device/functional detail level permissions and will always prioritize the “deny” over the “allow” setting.</p>
