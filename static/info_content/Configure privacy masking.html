        <p>Configure any camera privacy masks needed on the Devices &gt; Cameras &gt; Privacy Mask tab.</p>
        <p>Privacy masks are overlaid on all video (live and playback). </p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note</span><span class="span_3">:</span> The privacy mask behavior has recently changed:</p>
        <p class="Notetext">Versions 2017R3 and older have only one solid (black) privacy mask. If you change the privacy mask, the mask will change for all video, regardless of when it was recorded.</p>
        <p class="Notetext">Versions 2018R1 and newer have two privacy mask options, and either may be solid (gray) or blurred. The liftable mask may be removed by authorized users whereas the permanent mask may not. If you change a privacy mask, the change will NOT affect to already recorded video.</p>
        <p>Permissions to lift the privacy mask are global for a role and are set under Roles &gt; Overall Security &gt; Cameras.</p>
        <p>If you upgrade from 2017R3 or older to 2018R1 and newer, existing privacy masks will be converted to liftable masks.</p>
