        <h3 class="Heading3"><span class="span_2">15J. </span>Configure PTZ patrolling</h3>
        <p class="p_2">Patrolling profiles are the definitions of how patrolling should take place. This includes the order in which the camera should move between preset positions and how long it should remain at each position. </p>
        <p>Patrolling profiles may be started, paused, and stopped by rules or by users with adequate permissions.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Create PTZ Patrolling profiles</h4>
        <p>Create patrolling profiles for each PTZ camera as required by the system design requirements.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure preset order and time on position</h4>
        <p>Add presets, set the preset order, and specify the time on position for each patrol profile.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure custom transitions timing</h4>
        <p>By default, the time required for moving the camera from one preset position to another (the transition) is set to three seconds. During this time, motion detection is by default disabled on the camera since it will otherwise trigger a motion detection event. </p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> If you time a specific transition to be longer and you are/will be using software motion detection for rules or alarms (including recording on motion), you must adjust the expected time for that transition to avoid triggering the motion event. Remember to include the time the camera takes to zoom and focus when you time the transition.</p>
        <p>On some PTZ devices you can also adjust the transition speed if you want the camera to move at a slower speed between two presets—for example, to make a slow pan over a wide area. The option to set the transition speed is not available if you use presets imported from the hardware device.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Since software motion detection is disabled during transitions you must create a rule to record always if you want the slow pan to be recorded.</p>
        <p>Select whether to customize transitions and specify the speed of expected transition time for each transition as required by the system design requirements. Be mindful that a PTZ camera on a patrol is looking only at a limited FoV at any given time. More presets in the patrol profile means less time overall at each preset. </p>
