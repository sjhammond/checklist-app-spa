        <p>Verify the output settings for each input or input group on the Devices &gt; Output &gt; Settings tab and change them as needed.</p>
        <p>Selecting a group allows you to change settings on all the cameras in the group and any subgroups at the same time. As most settings are hardware device driver specific, you can filter the group by hardware device in the dropdown list at the top of the Properties window.</p>
        <p>Most output devices allow you to define a trigger time (the duration the output is held active when triggered), but the time interval you can choose varies between devices. Some output devices have additional settings, such as defining if the active output state is “closed” or “open”.</p>
