        <p>The XProtect VMS must access the device with administrator-level access. Most devices come with a preconfigured administrator account user name. You may use the built-in administrator account or create a new one. </p>
        <p>Some devices come with default passwords for the preconfigured user accounts. For security reasons, Milestone HIGHLY recommends you change any default passwords before deploying the camera, even if you will be deploying the camera to an isolated camera network that is reachable only by the recording server (recommended). </p>
