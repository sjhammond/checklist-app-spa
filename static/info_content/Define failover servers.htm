        <h3 class="Heading3">12A. Define failover servers</h3>
        <p>If you installed any Failover Recording Servers, you should see them in the Management Client<br />Servers &gt; Failover Servers node. You can review the server information, including the recording storage location, on the Info tab.</p>
        <p>Make sure the name of the server is one that makes sense and add a description of the location, intended use of the server, and anything else that may be useful when servicing the system months or years from now.</p>
        <p>If you will use one or more Failover Servers as cold standby servers, you must create a failover server group and assign the Failover Servers you want to be part of that failover group. You must also determine the failover sequence (priority) before you can assign the failover group to the appropriate Recording Servers. Generally, the most efficient approach is to configure this before configuring the Recording Servers.</p>
