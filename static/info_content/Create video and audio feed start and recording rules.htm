        <p>Create any additional rules on the Rules and Events &gt; Rules node for starting video, audio, and metadata feeds needed to meet the requirements of the installation.</p>
        <p>Create any additional rules for recording video, audio, and metadata needed to meet the requirements of the installation the same way.</p>
        <p>Make sure to disable or modify any rules that may conflict with these additional rules. For example, if you create a rule to record a camera only when an external infrared (IR) sensor detects motion, you must disable the Default Record on Motion Rule and create in its place a new rule that includes only the cameras that should record on motion.</p>
        <p>Also remember that if a video feed is not started, the XProtect VMS will not be able to show it live or record it.</p>
