        <h4 class="Heading4">Management Server</h4>
        <p>By default, only the user account that the Management Server service is running under and the user account used to install the software on the Management Server be able to log in with the XProtect Management Client with full administrator credentials. In preparation for installation, make sure the users you want to use for these purposes are created on the server.</p>
        <p>In some systems—particularly smaller systems or demo systems with only a few users—it may sometimes be easiest to simply use Basic Users or define additional users in Windows User Management and subsequently give those users permissions within the XProtect VMS. This would be a good time to create those Windows users. To prevent these users from gaining access to the server itself, you can either define those users in the Guests group or create a custom group that has no critical permissions on the server itself.</p>
        <p>If the server is on a domain with Microsoft Active Directory, you will, in almost all cases, want to use those AD groups (or individual users) to assign permissions within the XProtect VMS. This is a good time to verify or add the AD groups and users you plan to use.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Other XProtect VMS servers</h4>
        <p>In most cases, there are not special requirements for users defined in Windows User Management or Active Directory on servers other than the server running the Management Server service.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">There are, however, two notable exceptions:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">Servers used as recording servers that need access to a storage system that requires user authentication—for example, a network attached storage (NAS)—must have a Windows user defined that has full read, write, create, and delete file access on the NAS for the recorder server service to run under.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">Servers used as Failover Recording Servers must have a user created for the failover service to run under that allows the Failover Server service to start and stop the Failover Recording Server service.</li>
        </ul>
