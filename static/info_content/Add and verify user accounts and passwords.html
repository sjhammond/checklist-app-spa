        <h4 class="Heading4">Management Server</h4>
        <p>On the server running the Management Server service, any Windows user that is a member of the Windows User Management Administrators user group will by default also be able to log in with the XProtect Management Client with full administrator credentials. To ensure you are never left with a system you cannot log into, this setting cannot be changed, so you will typically want to make sure you limit this access as much as possible.</p>
        <p>In some systems—particularly smaller systems or demo systems with only a few users—it may sometimes be easiest to simply define additional users in Windows User Management and subsequently give those users permissions within the XProtect VMS.</p>
        <p>This would be a good time to create those users. You can either define those users in the Guests group or create a custom group that has no critical permissions on the server itself.</p>
        <p>If the server is on a domain with Microsoft Active Directory, you will, in almost all cases, want to use those AD groups (or individual users) to assign permissions within the XProtect VMS.</p>
        <p>This is a good time to verify or add the AD groups you plan to use.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Other XProtect VMS servers</h4>
        <p>In most cases, there are not special requirements for users defined in Windows User Management or Active Directory on servers other than the server running the Management Server service.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">There are, however, two notable exceptions:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">Servers used as recording servers that need access to a storage system that requires user authentication—for example, a network attached storage (NAS)—must have a Windows user defined that has full read, write, create, and delete file access on the NAS for the recorder server service to run under.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">Servers used as Failover Recording Servers must have a user created for the failover service to run under that allows the Failover Server service to start and stop the Failover Recording Server service.</li>
        </ul>
