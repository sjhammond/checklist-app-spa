        <h3 class="Heading3">22<span class="span_2">F. </span>Assign users and groups to each role</h3>
        <p>Add the users that should be associated with a role on the Users and Groups tab of the role. You can add Basic users that have already been created as well as Windows/Active Directory users and groups.</p>
        <p>Note that users assigned to the BUILTIN\Administrators role will always have full system administrator permissions in the XProtect VMS (the role permission tabs are grayed out).</p>
        <p>Also note that any user who is a member of the BUILTIN\Administrators group in Local Users and Groups in Windows user management—i.e., a user who can log into the physical server with Windows administrator privileges—is always assigned to the XProtect VMS Administrators role. You cannot remove those users from the role. This is a precaution to ensure that you never get into a situation where an administrator accidentally deletes all administrator users (including him/herself) and thereby is permanently locked out of the system with no option to get back in.</p>
