        <h3 class="Heading3">26<span class="span_2">C. </span>Configure connectivity settings</h3>
        <p>Access the connectivity settings of XProtect Mobile server on the Servers &gt; Mobile Servers &gt; Connectivity tab.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> As of version 2020R3, the Mobile server will accept either HTTP or HTTPS connections If a certificate is selected it with use HTTPS; otherwise, it will use HTTP.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify connection client timeout settings</h4>
        <p>The client timeout (http) setting determines how often XProtect Mobile client must indicate to the Mobile server that it is up and running. The default value (30 seconds) will work in most installations and should be increased only if you experience disconnect errors due to extreme latency that cannot be reduced. Be aware that the user experience will likely be greatly affected in networks with high latency.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure UPnP and internet access settings</h4>
        <p>When the Enable UPnP discoverability and Enable automatic port mapping check boxes are selected, and your network router has Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) support enabled, the router may automatically configure inbound access from the internet to XProtect Mobile server. If any of the XProtect Mobile server settings (such as IP address or ports) change, the router will automatically update its port forward settings.</p>
        <p>Unless the design specification explicitly specifies using UPnP to automatically configure inbound access, for network security reasons Milestone recommends you disable the UPnP discoverability option in the Mobile server and configure port forwarding manually as necessary. </p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure Smart Connect</h4>
        <p>Smart Connect allows you to send mobile users an email to add the XProtect Mobile server connection information to their XProtect Mobile client, so they donâ€™t have to manually type in technical details like IP address and ports.</p>
        <p>Enable Smart Connect if the installation will make use of this functionality.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Smart Connect requires the Mobile server to have access to the internet (outbound connection) and a valid Milestone Care Plus subscription. If XProtect Mobile server should be accessible from the Internet (inbound connection), this must be configured before sending the link to the user.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify firewall and router settings if not done under 1D</h4>
        <p>To enable inbound access in a non-UPnP network, simply configure inbound port forward in the routers manually, if you have not done so already. If you use UPnP, this should be configured automatically.</p>
        <p>Make sure the Windows firewall and any third-party antivirus software that uses real-time port scanning are configured to allow inbound access to XProtect Mobile server.</p>
        <p>Test whether XProtect Mobile server is accessible (i.e., that you can log in from a user account with the correct permissions) from any network the server should be accessible, including from the internet.</p>
        <p>Confirm, by testing, that XProtect Mobile server is not accessible (i.e., the server is unreachable, or access is denied) by user accounts (roles), clients, and networks that should not have access to the Mobile server.</p>
