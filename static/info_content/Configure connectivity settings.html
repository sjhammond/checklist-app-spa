        <h3 class="Heading3">25<span class="span_2">C. </span>Configure connectivity settings</h3>
        <p>Access the connectivity settings of the Milestone Mobile server on the Servers &gt; Mobile Servers &gt; Connectivity tab.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify connection type and client timeout settings</h4>
        <p>Configure what connection type (HTTP and/or HTTPS) users are permitted to use.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Devices running iOS 9.0 or later, or Windows Phone, require you to have a certificate from a certificate authority (CA) installed on the Mobile server. Once obtained, you install the certificate file from the Edit Certificate option in the Mobile server system tray menu.</p>
        <p>The client timeout (http) setting determines how often the Milestone Mobile client must indicate to the Mobile server that it is up and running. The default value (30 seconds) will work in most installations and should be increased only if you experience disconnect errors due to extreme latency that cannot be reduced. Be aware that the user experience will likely be greatly affected in networks with high latency.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure UPnP and Internet access settings</h4>
        <p>When the Enable UPnP discoverability and Enable automatic port mapping check boxes are selected, and your network router has Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) support enabled, the router may automatically configure inbound access from the Internet to the Milestone Mobile server. If any of the Milestone Mobile server settings (such as IP address or ports) change, the router will automatically update its port forward settings.</p>
        <p>If the network consists of multiple layers of routers, and UPnP is enabled throughout the network and the Mobile server, you must enable the Configure customer Internet access option in the Mobile server and manually specify the values you want the Mobile server to report to the UPnP-enabled network for the router chain to be configured correctly.</p>
        <p>For security reasons, most customers prefer to disable UPnP throughout their network and simply configure port forwarding manually so they maintain complete control of the network at all times.</p>
        <p>Therefore, unless the system design document explicitly specifies using UPnP to automatically configure inbound access, Milestone recommends you disable the UPnP discoverability option in the Mobile server and configure port forwarding manually as necessary. </p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure Smart Connect</h4>
        <p>Smart Connect allows you to send mobile users an email to add the Milestone Mobile server connection information to their Milestone Mobile client, so they don’t have to manually type in technical details like IP address and ports.</p>
        <p>After Smart Connect is enabled, you can specify one or more email addresses to send an invitation to. The XProtect VMS will relay the request to a Milestone server on the Internet which in turn will generate and send the email to the users, or you can copy and paste the token into an email yourself. </p>
        <p>The email from Milestone contains a link to install the Milestone Mobile app (the link automatically redirects the user to the appropriate app store for the device), and an “Add your server to Milestone Mobile” link. After the user has installed the app and clicks the link, the server is added to the server list in the app. </p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Smart Connect requires the Mobile server to have access to the Internet (outbound connection), and the Software License Code (SLC) used to have a valid Milestone Care Plus subscription. If the Milestone Mobile server should be accessible from the Internet (inbound connection), this must be configured before sending the link to the user.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify firewall and router settings if not done under 1D</h4>
        <p>To enable inbound access in a non-UPnP network, simply configure inbound port forward in the routers manually, if you have not done so already. If you use UPnP, this should be configured automatically.</p>
        <p>Make sure the Windows firewall and any third-party antivirus software that uses real-time port scanning are configured to allow inbound access to the Milestone Mobile server.</p>
        <p>Test whether the Milestone Mobile server is accessible (i.e., that you can log in from a user account with the correct permissions) from any network the server should be accessible, including from the Internet.</p>
        <p>Confirm, by testing, that the Milestone Mobile server is not accessible (i.e., the server is unreachable, or access is denied) by user accounts (roles), clients, and networks that should not have access to the Mobile server.</p>
