        <h3 class="Heading3">26<span class="span_2">C. </span>Configure connectivity settings</h3>
        <p>Access the connectivity settings of the XProtect Mobile server on the Servers &gt; Mobile Servers &gt; Connectivity tab.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify connection type and client timeout settings</h4>
        <p>Configure what connection type (HTTP and/or HTTPS) users are permitted to use.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> If a certificate issued by a certificate authority (CA) trusted by the mobile device is not installed and enabled on the Mobile server, disallow HTTPS connections.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><b>Note</b>: Milestone recommends not permitting HTTP connections if users can connect across open networks, such as the internet or open WiFi connections.</p>
        <p>The client timeout (http) setting determines how often the XProtect Mobile client must indicate to the Mobile server that it is up and running. The default value (30 seconds) will work in most installations and should be increased only if you experience disconnect errors due to extreme latency that cannot be reduced. Be aware that the user experience will likely be greatly affected in networks with high latency.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure UPnP and internet access settings</h4>
        <p>When the Enable UPnP discoverability and Enable automatic port mapping check boxes are selected, and your network router has Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) support enabled, the router may automatically configure inbound access from the internet to the XProtect Mobile server. If any of the XProtect Mobile server settings (such as IP address or ports) change, the router will automatically update its port forward settings.</p>
        <p>Unless the design specification explicitly specifies using UPnP to automatically configure inbound access, for network security reasons Milestone recommends you disable the UPnP discoverability option in the Mobile server and configure port forwarding manually as necessary. </p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Configure Smart Connect</h4>
        <p>Smart Connect allows you to send mobile users an email to add the XProtect Mobile server connection information to their XProtect Mobile client, so they donâ€™t have to manually type in technical details like IP address and ports.</p>
        <p>Enable Smart Connect if the installation will make use of this functionality.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Smart Connect requires the Mobile server to have access to the internet (outbound connection) and a valid Milestone Care Plus subscription. If the XProtect Mobile server should be accessible from the Internet (inbound connection), this must be configured before sending the link to the user.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify firewall and router settings if not done under 1D</h4>
        <p>To enable inbound access in a non-UPnP network, simply configure inbound port forward in the routers manually, if you have not done so already. If you use UPnP, this should be configured automatically.</p>
        <p>Make sure the Windows firewall and any third-party antivirus software that uses real-time port scanning are configured to allow inbound access to the XProtect Mobile server.</p>
        <p>Test whether the XProtect Mobile server is accessible (i.e., that you can log in from a user account with the correct permissions) from any network the server should be accessible, including from the internet.</p>
        <p>Confirm, by testing, that the XProtect Mobile server is not accessible (i.e., the server is unreachable, or access is denied) by user accounts (roles), clients, and networks that should not have access to the Mobile server.</p>
