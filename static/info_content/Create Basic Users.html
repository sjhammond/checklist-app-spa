        <p>Whereas Windows users are authenticated by Active Directory or by Windows locally on the management server, based on their Windows login, Basic Users are authenticated within the XProtect VMS Management Server.</p>
        <p>A Basic User is simply a username and password pair created in the XProtect VMS by the system administrator. Users cannot change their passwords themselves. Basic users are typically used in smaller systems where there is no Microsoft Active Directory server available for user management and authentication. </p>
        <p>Create the Basic Users under Security &gt; Basic Users, as required by the design specification.</p>
