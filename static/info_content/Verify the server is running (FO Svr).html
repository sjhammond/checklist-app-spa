        <p class="Bulletlistheading">The Failover Recording Server consists of two server services:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">Failover Server, which monitors the Recording Servers and controls the Failover Recording Server start and stop, as well as the transfer of recordings back to the Recording Server once it recovers from a failover situation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">Failover Recording Server, which takes over recording and streaming duties for a failed Recording Server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Verify the XProtect Failover Server notification area tray icon shows the Failover Server has started correctly (i.e., the icon status is green).</p>
        <p>Note that, since the Failover Recording Server is not active at this time, the XProtect Recording Server tray icon will indicate the Recording Server itself is not running.</p>
        <p>Verify the Windows Firewall (if enabled) allows inbound access to all ports used by the Recording Server.</p>
