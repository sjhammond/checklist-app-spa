        <p>In the XProtect VMS, users are assigned to roles, which in turn determine what permissions each user has in the system. The XProtect VMS always has an Administrators role defined which cannot be deleted or modified. </p>
        <p>Create additional roles as required by the system specification under Security &gt; Roles.</p>
        <p>Note that when you create a role, the system automatically creates a View Group for the role in which to create and store Smart Client views, in addition to the Private View Group each individual user has access to. You can remove the role View Group under Client &gt; View Groups node if it is not required by the system specification.</p>
