        <p>It is critical for the correct operation of a Milestone system that the date and time of all servers and workstations are accurate to within five minutes. If the installation makes use of onboard edge storage on devices (such as cameras), or if you intend to use the camerasâ€™ on-screen date and time stamps, it is further critical that the date and time in the edge device are as closely synchronized with the recording server as possible.</p>
        <p>XProtect VMS uses UTC time internally, so hosts can be in different time zones as long as the time zone is set correctly and the host or device is using the correct time for their time zone.</p>
        <p>Milestone recommends always using an NTP time source for all time-critical hosts and devices. This may be either a public NTP server, such as time.microsoft.com, or a local time server. If a workstation or server is a member of a domain, it will usually synchronize to the domain server time automatically.</p>
        <p>If a host does not have internet access and the host is not a member of a domain, Milestone recommends installing a local NTP server, either as a software or hardware solution. Similarly, it may be necessary to install a local NTP server for devices (such as cameras) to synchronize to, especially in systems where devices are isolated on a separate network where the Milestone Recording Servers are the only host they can access.</p>
        <p>In this latter case, very often the only way to enable devices to synchronize their internal clocks is to install a software NTP on the recording server or add a hardware NTP server to the camera network.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Examples of local time servers are:</p>
