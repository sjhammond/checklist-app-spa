        <p>Download and run the Recording Server installer on the server(s) you want to use as failover recording server(s) and choose the failover installation option.</p>
        <p>You must specify a Failover Recording Server name, the hostname (or IP address), and port of the Management Server, and select a default path for recordings, as you do for a regular Recording Server. </p>
        <p>Specify the Windows user account you want the Recording Server to run under. If the servers are running in a Workgroup environment, the Recording Server must run under a user with the same user name as the Management Server.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> You cannot use a recording server also as a failover recording server. It can be only one or the other.</p>
