        <h3 class="Heading3"><span class="span_2">15C. </span>Configure streams</h3>
        <p>Add (or remove) and select the streams (defined under the Settings tab) you want to use for each camera or group of cameras on the Devices &gt; Cameras &gt; Streams tab. Cameras must be the same make and model within the group for the settings to be available.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Name video streams</h4>
        <p>You should name each video stream according to its intended use for later reference and to assist operators in selecting the correct live stream in the Smart Client.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Select video stream mode and options</h4>
        <p>Select the Live Mode and select which stream to use as the default live stream in clients and which stream the Recording Server should record. The recording stream is also the stream the Recording Server will use for software video motion detection (VMD).</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Streams selected as default stream or recording stream will always be streaming (rules permitting) regardless of what Live Mode you select for that stream.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Not all XProtect VMS versions support multiple live streams to Smart Clients.</p>
