        <h3 class="Heading3"><span class="span_2">15D. </span>Configure streams</h3>
        <p>Add (or remove) and select the streams (defined under the Settings tab) you want to use for each camera or group of cameras on the Devices &gt; Cameras &gt; Streams tab. Cameras must be the same make and model within the group for the settings to be available.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Name video streams</h4>
        <p>You should name each video stream according to its intended use for later reference and to assist operators in selecting the correct live stream in the Smart Client.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Select video stream mode and options</h4>
        <p>Select the Live Mode and select which stream to use as the default live stream in clients and which stream the Recording Server should record. The recording stream is also the stream the Recording Server will use for software video motion detection (VMD).</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Streams selected as default stream or recording stream will always be streaming (rules permitting) regardless of what Live Mode you select for that stream.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><b>Note</b>: Setting the live mode of streams not selected as default or recording stream to “when needed” may save bandwidth as the stream is started only when actively viewed in the XProtect Smart Client. You must, however, make sure there is always sufficient bandwidth for all streams to run simultaneously to avoid dropped frames in those situations.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><b>Note</b>: The default stream is always used by the XProtect Mobile server which transcodes (downscales and re-encodes in MJPEG) it. If you have multiple streams configured, you can often save processing power on the Mobile server by selecting a lower resolution stream without affecting the quality viewed on the XProtect Mobile client.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Not all XProtect VMS versions support multiple live streams to Smart Clients.</p>
