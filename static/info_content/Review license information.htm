        <h3 class="Heading3">11A. Review license information</h3>
        <p>Because the software license file determines what product you have installed, you should verify it matches what you expected.</p>
        <p>You should also verify that the Milestone Care information is correct and that the license overview lists the expected number of hardware devices and Milestone Interconnect camera channels.</p>
        <p>If what is shown under license information does not correspond to what was ordered, you must activate the license in order to update it with the latest information from the Milestone license server before contacting Milestone Partner Service and Sales Support.</p>
