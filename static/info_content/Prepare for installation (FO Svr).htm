        <p>In addition to the preparations discussed for a regular Recording Server, because a service running under the NETWORK SERVICE account does not have permissions to start and stop other services, you must make sure the Failover Recording Server has a user specified under Windows User Management that you can use to run the Failover Server service.</p>
        <p>The user must be a member of the Administrators group or otherwise have administrator privileges. In a workgroup environment, the user name should be the same as that running the Management Server to ensure the System Monitor function is able to receive performance data from the server.</p>
