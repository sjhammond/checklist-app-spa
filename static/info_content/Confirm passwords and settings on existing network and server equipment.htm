        <h3 class="Heading3">1A. Confirm passwords and settings on existing network and server equipment</h3>
        <p>Before installing any new equipment, you should confirm what relevant network and server equipment is already installed and document key configuration parameters. These may include access credentials, network settings, operating system version, installed patches, and other settings that may be relevant for the installation. Doing this now may save you a lot of time tracking down the information later.</p>
