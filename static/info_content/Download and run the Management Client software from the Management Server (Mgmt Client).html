        <h3 class="Heading3"><span class="span_2">9C. </span>Download and run the Management Client software from the Management Server</h3>
        <p>Download and run the Management Client installer on the workstation(s) you or the customer will be using for managing the XProtect VMS. </p>
        <p>The XProtect Management Client installation file is available on the Management Server administrative installation page: <span class="span_5">http://&lt;management server&gt;/installation/admin</span></p>
        <p class="Notetext"><b>Note</b>: If you have a newer version of the XProtect Management Client installed—for example, on your service laptop—it will usually work with older versions of the Management Server as well. If you have an older version installed, you will usually be prompted to upgrade before you can log into the system.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><b>Note</b>: Beginning with version 2017R1, the XProtect Mobile server plug-in is automatically installed with the Management Client installer, eliminating the need to do this step separately.</p>
