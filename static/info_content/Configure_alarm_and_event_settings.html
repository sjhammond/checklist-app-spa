        <p>The alarms feature in the XProtect VMS provides the user with a central overview, control, and scalability of alarms.</p>
        <p>If you will be using alarms, you should verify the default alarm retention times configured on the Tools &gt; Options &gt; Alarms and Events tab meet your system requirements.</p>
        <p>Events used for alarms and rules are handled by the Event Server service that is typically installed on the management server.</p>
        <p>Once an event has triggered the alarm or rule, it has usually outlived its purpose and, for that reason, is not stored or is stored for only a short time, by default. If, for any reason, you need to change if or how long one or more event types is stored, you can do so on the Tools &gt; Options &gt; Alarms and Events tab.</p>
