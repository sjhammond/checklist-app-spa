        <p>If you will be archiving to a NAS storage or recording or archiving to a SAN, you must make sure the user running the Recording Server service has full file access permissions on the storage resource.</p>
        <p>For performance and database integrity reasons, Milestone strongly recommends you never record to a storage system that is not permanently and directly attached to the recording server, such as a NAS or USB drive. Doing so may result in loss of evidence and force the need for a database repair if the connection momentarily breaks.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note: </span>In cases where the risk of losing connectivity is extremely small, it is generally acceptable to regard a redundant iSCSI connection as being a direct attached connection.</p>
