        <p>If you need to move a hardware device to a different Recording Server, the Move Hardware wizard allows you to do so while retaining all settings and all recordings.</p>
        <p>On the Servers &gt; Recording Servers node in the Management Client, select the Recording Server the hardware device is currently installed to. Right-click on the device and select Move Hardware to start the wizard.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> When moving a device, any users viewing the live feed from that device may experience a short interruption until the Service Channel updates the client with the new location of the device.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Existing recordings are not moved. When a user accesses those recordings, the new recording server connects to the original recording server via port 5210 and streams the recordings to the user client.</p>
