        <h3 class="Heading3">10A. Log in with the Management Client</h3>
        <p>With the Management Server installed, you can log in with the XProtect Management Client.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Windows Authentication and Windows Authentication (current user)</h4>
        <p>By default, only Windows users that are members of the Windows User Management Administrators user group on the server running the Management Server service are able to log into the XProtect VMS. To ensure you are never left with a system you cannot log into, this setting cannot be changed. You will typically want to make sure you limit this access as much as possible.</p>
        <p>You can log in either with the Management Client installed on the server or one installed elsewhere, typically your normal workstation or laptop.</p>
        <p>If you are already logged into Windows with credentials that meet the requirements described above, you can use the Windows Authentication (current user) option. Otherwise, you must choose Windows Authentication and specify those credentials. If you are not working directly on the management server, you may need to prefix the username with the hostname (or domain name) of the management server.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Common reasons why login fails:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">The time difference between the workstation and the management server is more than 5 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">The time zone settings are not correct on either the workstation or the server.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">The management server hostname does not resolve correctly from the workstation.</li>

        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">The user is not a member of the Administrators group on the management server.</li>
