        <h3 class="Heading3">2A. Set a static IP address or configure DHCP and hostname</h3>
        <p>Most installations use a static IP address for hardware devices such as cameras and encoders, but in some cases the design may specify using dynamically assigned IP addresses.</p>
        <p>If you use a static IP address, you simply configure the IP address, network mask, and optionally a gateway in the camera. Specifying the gateway is necessary only if you want the camera to access the Internet (not recommended for security reasons) or the recording server is on a different network segment from the camera (not recommended for performance reasons).</p>
        <p>If you need to assign the IP address dynamically, make sure to set or verify the hostname of the camera and confirm the camera is receiving an IP address in the correct IP range from the DHCP server and that the hostname of the camera resolves correctly from the recording server. </p>
        <p>The easiest way to test this is to connect the camera to the intended camera network and ping the camera hostname from the recording server or another PC connected to the recording server network.</p>
        <p>Also note that, if you use dynamically assigned IP addresses, because the IP address is by definition subject to change, you must specify the hostnames individually using the Manual detection mode in the XProtect VMS.</p>
