        <p>The settings on the Overall Security tab comprise the primary way of defining permissions for the role.</p>
        <p>XProtect VMS has a number of security groups, under which are a number of system components. For each component, you can configure the overall security to allow, deny, or remain undefined (no option selected).</p>
        <p>Configure Overall Security settings for each role, as per your design specification, on the Overall Security tab for the role.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> You can associate a user with more than one role, in which case you may end up having conflicting settings. In this case, XProtect VMS will always prioritize an overall security setting (allow or deny) over any individual device/functional detail level permissions and will always prioritize the “deny” over the “allow” setting.</p>
