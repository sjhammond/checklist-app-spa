        <p>In many cases, the steps above are all you need to do to make the hardware device ready to use. In some cases, however, you may need or want to do additional configuration, such as setting up onboard hardware motion detection, events, analytics, or metadata.</p>
        <p>Milestone also generally recommends you disable any on-screen date and time stamps on cameras. The XProtect VMS will automatically timestamp all video, audio, and metadata when it is recorded. The timestamp is used for recording searches, playback, and evidence export.</p>
        <p>If the on-screen time stamp is enabled, and the camera is not synchronized to the same time source as the recording server, the exported evidence will show two different times which may lead to confusion as to the time the evidence was recorded.</p>
