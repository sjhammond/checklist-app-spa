        <h4 class="Heading4">Explain the importance of acceptance testing (Final Acceptance Test, FAT)</h4>
        <p>The Final Acceptance Test (FAT) is the last step before the customer takes ownership of the installation.</p>
        <p>If sufficiently detailed, the SOW and the associated sequential checklist (i.e., this document) contain everything that was agreed upon when the customer accepted the scope and price of the proposed project.</p>
        <p>Going through each of the steps in the SOW together with the customer is your proof that the project delivered is the project the customer bought. </p>
        <p>Getting the customer’s signature on the FAT document swiftly and without need for major corrections is therefore key in closing the project to everyone’s satisfaction and, typically, critical for the customer to release the final payment to your company.</p>
        <p>It is also a great time to suggest and secure a contract for additional work that might not have been included in the original project (including change orders) or that addresses additional needs the customer might have.</p>
