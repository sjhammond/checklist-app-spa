        <p>Make a backup of the configuration with the File &gt; Configuration Backup function. </p>
        <p>The configuration backup is a convenient tool to have in case the system has to be reverted to the original configuration after the handover to the customer. Take a copy with you for safekeeping and leave a copy by the management server for convenience.</p>
        <p>If you are using a full version of Microsoft SQL (i.e., not SQL Express), Milestone highly recommends you also set up scheduled backups of the SQL database to a separate location, so you will always have a recent copy to revert to in case of a catastrophic event.</p>
