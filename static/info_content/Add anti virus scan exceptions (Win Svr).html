        <p>If you run an anti-virus solution on the server, you must add the recommended exceptions to the real-time and disk scanning routines in order not to impact system performance.</p>
        <p>The required exceptions include real-time and periodic scanning of the specific file extensions that are used by the XProtect Recording Server database (.blk, .idx, and .pic), and the folders and subfolders used by the various Management Server services, the Recording Server service, and the XProtect Mobile server service. Depending on the anti-virus software you may also need to exclude any real-time scanning of the IP ports those services use or the server processes themselves.</p>
        <p>The exceptions must be added to all servers running an XProtect VMS server service or storage, including SAN or NAS servers.</p>
        <p>The customerâ€™s organization may have strict guidelines regarding virus scanning, but it is important that you meet these requirements to prevent compromising the server, storage, and system performance.</p>
