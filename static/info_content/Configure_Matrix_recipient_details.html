        <p>With Matrix, rules configured in the XProtect VMS, as well as Smart Client users, can initiate any camera to be displayed at any user running a Matrix recipientâ€™s view.</p>
        <p>The Matrix functionality can, to some degree, be used to substitute some of the Smart Wall functionality in XProtect VMS systems that do not have Smart Wall included. For XProtect Corporate systems, you should always use the superior XProtect Smart Wall functionality for user interaction.</p>
        <p>The XProtect VMS supports two types of Matrix recipients: a stand-alone Matrix application and Smart Client Matrix. The stand-alone Matrix application had a number of design disadvantages and was terminated (end-of-life, with no support or updates) in 2012. Milestone highly discourages using the stand-alone Matrix application.</p>
        <p>Configure XProtect Smart Client Matrix recipients as necessary on the Client &gt; Matrix node.</p>
