        <h3 class="Heading3"><span class="span_2">21C. </span>Create other installation-specific rules</h3>
        <p>Create all other rules needed to meet the requirements of the installation.</p>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Note about rule complexity:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">If you require a complex system behavior, where a condition (event) will have multiple actions, it is good practice to create multiple simple rules rather than a single complex rule. Even though this results in more rules in your system, simpler rules are much easier to understand and thus maintain an overview of what your rules do.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">Keeping your rules simple also means that you have much more flexibility when it comes to deactivating/activating individual rule elements. With simple rules, you can deactivate/activate entire rules when required and copy and modify rules if new behaviors are required.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Note about rule names:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">Rules are sorted alphabetically by name. When you create rules, Milestone recommends you take extra care and follow a naming convention that will allow you and other system administrators to easily review the rules in order to understand the system behavior and to quickly find a rule if it needs to be modified or copied.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">One suggestion is to always start the rule name with its (primary) action—for example, “START FEED” or “RECORD”. If you do this, because the rules are always listed alphabetically, they will automatically be listed by their function.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">In addition, you should take care to give each rule a name that clearly explains the key behavior of the rule. This makes it relatively easy to get a good overview of how the system is configured, even if it has been a long time since the system was last serviced and/or if the system documentation is not fully updated or available. Remember to add any additional useful details in the description field.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Bulletlistheading">Examples of rule names following this naming convention:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">EMAIL – Notify admin on disk free space threshold warning</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">RECORD – Always on outdoor cameras</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">RECORD – On motion on indoor cameras</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">RECORD – On PTZ manual session</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">RECORD AUDIO – On admin reception front door when is doorbell activated</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">SMART WALL - Trigger lockdown preset on lockdown user-defined event</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A naming convention is, of course, most effective if all system administrators use the same convention and strictly adhere to it. This also applies when servicing and expanding the system after the initial installation has been handed over to the customer.</p>
