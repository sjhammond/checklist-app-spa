        <p>Select what client applications users of the role are permitted to use—e.g., XProtect Smart Client, XProtect Mobile Client, and/or XProtect Web Client.</p>
        <p>Select whether two-step login authorization (sometimes also referred to as “four-eye authorization” or “two-man rule”) is required for users in this role. If selected, XProtect Smart Client, XProtect Web Client, and the Management Client will ask for a second user, who must have user authorization privileges (typically by a supervisor or manager), to also provide their credentials before the user is logged in. </p>
        <p>The Authorize users permission option is located on the Overall Security tab.</p>
        <p>Select whether to make users anonymous during PTZ sessions. When this option is selected, the user will show up as “anonymous” instead of by user name on the “PTZ controlled by” and “PTZ session reserved by” notifications in XProtect Smart Client (located in the PTZ menu on the camera’s tool bar). The setting does not influence the (optional) Audit Log user access logging information.</p>
