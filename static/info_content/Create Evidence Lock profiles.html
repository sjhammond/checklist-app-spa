        <p>The evidence lock functionality allows users to protect video sequences from being deletedâ€”for example, while an investigation or trial is ongoing. This protection also covers audio and other data from devices related to the selected cameras.</p>
        <p>Once an evidence lock is in place, the system protects the data from being deleted. This means that users cannot delete the data until a user with sufficient user rights unlocks the evidence or the evidence lock expires based on the configured retention time.</p>
        <p>User roles are assigned an evidence lock profile that contains one or more locking intervals, as appropriate for that user role. If you will be allowing users to create evidence locks, you must define the evidence lock profiles you will be assigning to the user roles on the Tools &gt; Options &gt; Evidence Lock tab.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Evidence locks are not supported in all product versions.</p>
