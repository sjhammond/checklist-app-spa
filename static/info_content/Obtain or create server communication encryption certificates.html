        <h3 class="Heading3">3A. Obtain or create server communication encryption certificates</h3>
        <p>If encryption is required for one or more XProtect server communication flows, obtaining the certificates may take some time. Starting the process of obtaining certificates even before you start installing the operating system may save you time and delays later on.</p>
        <p>Milestone recommends that you establish a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for creating and distributing certificates. In a Windows domain, it is recommended to establish a PKI using the Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).</p>
        <p>If you are unable to use a PKI, you must manually create and distribute certificates to use server encryption.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><b>Note</b>: If you use manual distribution of certificates you are responsible for keeping the private certificates secure at all times. When you keep the private certificates secure, the client computers that trust the certificates are less vulnerable to attacks.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><b>Note</b>: Because manually installing your own CA certificates on mobile devices can be challenging and is not regarded as secure, Milestone recommends obtaining server certificates for the mobile servers from a CA that is natively trusted by the mobile devices.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><b>Note</b>: As server communication encryption is primarily relevant to services external to the management server, single-server installation can usually omit using management server communication encryption without compromising security.</p>
