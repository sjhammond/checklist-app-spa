        <h3 class="Heading3"><span class="span_2">15B. </span>Configure general camera settings </h3>
        <p>Set up the general image settings for a camera or a camera group on the Devices &gt; <br />Cameras &gt; Settings tab as required by the project documentation.</p>
        <p>The general settings typically include image-related settings such as brightness, contrast, saturation, image rotation, auto iris, day/night mode, and shutter speed. On some devices, it may also include date and time stamp overlay settings and other settings that are common for all streams from the hardware device.</p>
        <p>Selecting a group allows you to change settings all at once on all the cameras in that group and any subgroups. As most settings are hardware device driver specific, you can filter the group by hardware device in the dropdown list at the top of the Properties window.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><b>Note</b>: There is no memory associated with a device group; it is simply a way to easily select a large group of devices.  If the devices in the group currently have different values configured for a specific setting, the value field is shown as blank.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note</span><span class="span_3">: </span>The ability to change some device properties—for example, resolution, rotation, brightness, and similar image settings—is limited to groups of 400 devices or less.</p>
