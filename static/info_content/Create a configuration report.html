        <h3 class="Heading3">31B. Create a configuration report</h3>
        <p>Create a configuration report to go with the installation documentation on the System Dashboard &gt; Configuration Reports node in the XProtect Management Client. Make sure to fill out the Front Page information as completely as possible, including adding your company logo. Include only report categories where you have made configurations in the export.</p>
        <p>The configuration report is a great document to supplement all your other project and installation documentation, and it includes fields both you and the customer can sign as part of the Final Acceptance Test handover process.</p>
