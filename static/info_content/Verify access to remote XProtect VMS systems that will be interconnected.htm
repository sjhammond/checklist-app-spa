        <p>Milestone Interconnect™ allows multiple remote sites running any paid-license XProtect VMS product to be linked with a central XProtect Corporate site.</p>
        <p>If you are installing XProtect Corporate and the installation will be using Milestone Interconnect to connect to remote sites, you should verify you can successfully connect to, and view camera feeds from, each of the remote sites from the location of the XProtect Corporate Management Server through the XProtect<sup>®</sup> Smart Client.</p>
        <p>By doing this as early in the project as possible, you help ensure against having to do time-consuming troubleshooting later on during the system-configuration phase of the project.</p>
