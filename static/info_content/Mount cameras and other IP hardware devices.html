        <p>Since it is generally easier to correct problems before mounting a camera or other IP hardware device, Milestone generally recommends you complete steps 2A, 2B, and 2C before mounting the device.</p>
        <p>When the device is mounted, you can perform location-specific tasksâ€”such as adjusting the field of view (FoV) and focus to match the statement of work (SOW) or design specification, and connecting I/O and audio wires.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> Depending on the device, the tools you have available, and your preferred method of working, it may be beneficial to defer this step until after you have added the device to the XProtect VMS. This way, if the installation includes access through a WiFi access point, or you choose to set up a temporary access point, you can use the XProtect Mobile client on a tablet when adjusting the FoV and focus.</p>
