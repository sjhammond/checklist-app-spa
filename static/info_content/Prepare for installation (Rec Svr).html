        <p>Before installing a Recording Server, you should verify if the cameras you plan to use are supported in the device pack that comes with the Recording Server.</p>
        <p>If you are installing the latest version for the software, the device pack will always be less than about four months old. If you are installing a Recording Server with an older version of XProtect VMS or your device or device firmware is very recently released, you should download the newest device pack from the Milestone website.</p>
        <p>If one or more of your hardware devices is listed as supported in the legacy device pack, you should make sure this is installed prior to installing the recording server.</p>
        <p>In very rare cases, you can have a situation where the older firmware in a device is not compatible with the latest device packs but is supported in an older device pack. In these cases, Milestone will always recommend upgrading your device firmware to a version supported in the latest device pack. If, for some reason, that is undesirable, you may install an older device pack to overwrite the newer drivers.</p>
        <p>For simplicity and ease of troubleshooting, Milestone recommends you always use the same device pack on all recording and Failover Recording Servers.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> The Legacy Device Driver requires restarting the Recording Server Service or rebooting the server after installation, even if the installer does not prompt you to do this.</p>
