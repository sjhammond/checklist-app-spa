        <h3 class="Heading3">7A. Prepare for installation</h3>
        <p>Before installing a Recording Server, you should verify if the cameras you plan to use are supported in the device pack that comes with the Recording Server.</p>
        <p>If you are installing the latest version for the software, the device pack will always be less than about four months old. If you are installing a Recording Server with an older version of the XProtect VMS or your device or device firmware is very recently released, you should download the newest device pack from the Milestone website.</p>
        <p>If one or more of your hardware devices is listed as supported in the legacy device pack, you should make sure this is installed prior to installing the recording server.</p>
        <p>In very rare cases, you can have a situation where the older firmware in a device is not compatible with the latest device packs but is supported in an older device pack. In these cases, Milestone will always recommend upgrading your device firmware to a version supported in the latest device pack. If, for some reason, that is undesirable, you may install an older device pack to overwrite the newer drivers.</p>
        <p>For simplicity and ease of troubleshooting, Milestone recommends you always use the same device pack on all recording and Failover Recording Servers.</p>
        <p class="Notetext"><span class="span_3">Note:</span> The Legacy Device Driver requires restarting the Recording Server Service or rebooting the server after installation, even if the installer does not prompt you to do this.</p>
