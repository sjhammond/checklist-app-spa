        <h3 class="Heading3">23A. Verify Windows users and groups</h3>
        <p>Windows users are either users or groups created in Microsoft Active Directory (AD) or local Windows users defined on the Management Server itself.</p>
        <p>Active Directory allows you to piggyback on the process the customer already uses for managing access and permissions to their network resources. You therefore need to define permissions on the AD group level only once. As the manager of the Active Directory adds and removes users from the group, their access to and permissions in XProtect VMS automatically change accordingly.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Verify Windows Active Directory groups and users (if not done under 1G)</h4>
        <p>Verify the AD user groups exist that are relevant for roles you plan to use in XProtect VMS and that the AD is reachable from the Management Server. If you plan to add individual AD users to a role, this is a good time to ensure those users are created in the AD.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Create Windows users locally on the Management Server</h4>
        <p>If you plan to add local Windows users to a role, you must create them in Windows user management directly on the management server. Local Windows users are most commonly used in demo systems and systems with few users, as an alternative to Basic Users.</p>
